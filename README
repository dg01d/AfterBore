These are small scripts for KoLMafia, designed to take over 
some of the uninteresting tasks which are usually done in 
Aftercore. As these tasks are often mindlessly tedious, the 
moniker AfterBore was created.

These rely on the following scripts:
http://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?1519 -- eatdrink.ash 
http://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?1005 -- consumption.ash
http://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?2072 -- zlib.ash
http://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?3842 -- htmlform.ash

          You MUST run the Relay Script to
          set configuration options before
          attempting to use AfterBore.ash 

Enjoy.
