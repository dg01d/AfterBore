These are small scripts for KoLMafia, designed to take over 
some of the uninteresting tasks which are usually done in 
Aftercore. As these tasks are often mindlessly tedious, the 
moniker AfterBore was created.

These rely on the following scripts:
http://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?1519 -- eatdrink.ash 
http://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?1005 -- consumption.ash
http://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?2072 -- zlib.ash
http://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?3842 -- htmlform.ash

relay_AfterBore.ash goes in your relay/ folder
Fax-List.txt goes in your data/ folder
AfterBore.ash goes in your scripts/ folder

      You MUST run the Relay Script to
      set configuration options before
      attempting to use AfterBore.ash!

Enjoy.
